The events that took place during the Egyptian uprising engendered an unprecedented flow
of information and ideas on Twitter. People who were watching their Twitter timelines could
literally see the events unfolding before their own eyes. One wonders what would have happened
if someone collected all this information and tried to make sense of it. What if we could be able
to detect events and describe them as they are happening? This is the question this project sets
out to answer, not in a science fiction way but following a structured and scientific methodology.
In this report we present the work done so far in the project and the methodology we have
employed to achieve our goals.
