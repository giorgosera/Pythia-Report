In this chapter we will explain in detail the methodology we have followed to construct the 
data mining system which can extract events from Twitter data. The system comprises of a number
of individual components which when combined together construct a complete framework for 
event extraction. These components are explained in detail in the sections below and a prototypical
application which uses this framework will be presented in Chapter \ref{chap:Application}.

\section{Methodology overview}

The main idea behind our methodology for event detction is that similar events will be described by tweets having similar
content. Therefore, the main task in our methodology is to cluster the tweets in different groups. Having done that
we can then further investigate these clusters and identify which ones are events and also extract useful information from them.
This procedure is described in detail in the rest of this chapter and Figure 3.1 depicts an overview of the system. 
Initially, the system receives a stream of tweets from the database and process them to be transformed in a clustering-friendly format. 
The next step in the pipeline is the actual clustering of the tweets in order to detect groups of tweets discussing the same topic.
Finally, the extracted clusters are processed in order to identify the events and extract a textual summary of each one.
